        <h1>Andres Soto Plaza's Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>Hi. My name is Andres Soto Plaza, and I am a junior studying Applied Data Analytics, working to use my skills in the digital retail space. I was born February 11, 2004, in <strong>San Juan, Puerto Rico</strong>. I completed over 150 community service hours before graduating high school. Moreover, I won the Legion of Valor bronze medal at the national level through my ROTC program, an award based on academic excellence and community engagement. I’m also a brother in KTP, the iSchool’s professional technology fraternity. I enjoy playing pick-up basketball, listening to podcasts, cooking, and trying out new music. My favorite hobby is definitely making music with my friends when I’m back home. </p>
