        <h2>3. Accessing Schine</h2>
        <p>To help support public health guidelines and the flow of visitors, Schine will be accessible from the Einhorn Family Walk and the Waverly Ave entrances only. Both entrances are wheelchair accessible with easy access to building elevators.

            If you head to an area to find it full, consider heading to another spot or coming back at another time. There is signage posted and on tables, so make sure you’re following the occupancy and seating limits. There is plenty of space within the building to support social distancing, so please ensure you’re doing so! We also need to limit our time in spaces to no more than two hours. Let’s make sure we all get the chance to experience Schine, yeah?!
            
            Don’t forget to bring your Syracuse University I.D. Due to COVID-19, non-Syracuse University/SUNY-ESF students, faculty or staff are not permitted in the building. You’ll also you’re your I.D. after 8 p.m. to swipe into the building.</p>
      

        <h2>4. Food and Beverages</h2>
        <p>Food and drinks are only allowed in designated dining and café areas. We know it’s not ideal, but it’s what we need to do to keep each other safer. And let’s be real, do we really want to be that person that puts others in an uncomfortable position? Staff will be around enforcing these rules, so let’s make their jobs less stressful!

            As always, wear your mask, practice social distancing, and follow public health guidelines!</p>
